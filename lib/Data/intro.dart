She recounted that Gohar Shahi was not born in the usual way that other children are. When asked for details, she explained that even before his birth, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) appeared to her in a dream and said, "We are going to give you Riaz." On the day of delivery, she recalled, she was resting and suddenly felt the sensation of a child pushing his legs within her. She woke up and was astonished to see a child already present near her in the room. The entire experience was beyond ordinary—she did not feel any pain, as though it was the divine birth of someone extraordinary who had arrived directly from the heavens. The room was filled with an enchanting fragrance and a profound sense of peace. She described Riaz as someone unlike any other child.
The followers of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi firmly believe that his arrival on Earth was miraculous and did not involve a typical childbirth process. They regard Riaz as a divine personality Who came to this universe to guide humanity and reconnect them with God.
## Childhood of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
Childhood of his Holliness is very intersting and Mysterious too. From early age His Holliness was attention of whole village peoples. People used to come His Home to ask For prayer in favour of them. His Hollines also spent some days of his childhood life in Indian New Delhi also becuase of His Father posting there. In New Delhi He would often disappear from home and his parrent would find him near tombs of Saints. His Mother told that She would often reamin worried bcz of Riaz Disappearnce from Home . She told A Spritual Man on Horse in white Clothes often come and would tell Her " Dont Worry for Riaz, "
His Hollines Riaz Ahmed Father says (taken from His Hollines book):
- His Divine Eminence developed inclination towards shrines of the Saints since His childhood. The father of His Divine Eminence says, "At the age of 5-6 years, His Divine Eminence would disappear, and we would find Him sitting at the shrine of Nizam Uddin Auliya in New Delhi, India. Occasionally, it seemed to me that His Divine Eminence was talking to Nizam Uddin Auliya." This incident dates back to the time when the father of His Divine Eminence resided in Delhi for his job.
## Early Age Of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
His Holiness Gohar Shahi exhibited extraordinary humility and kindness from a very young age. According to his village friends, he was deeply considerate of all living beings, no matter how small. For instance, when walking along the edge of a water canal, while others might inadvertently step on ants or insects, His Holiness would take great care to avoid harming them. This compassion extended to humans as well. If a car or bus broke down on a road near his village, he would not simply ignore the stranded passengers. Instead, he would personally prepare food and tea and take it to the spot to assist them. Even as a young boy, His Holiness showed a profound commitment to helping the poor and those in need, demonstrating a genuine desire to ease the struggles of others. His actions reflected a heart full of empathy and a spirit devoted to service.
From an early age, His Holiness Gohar Shahi displayed a profound interest in spirituality and Sufism. He would frequently visit the tombs of spiritual saints, seeking solace and divine connection in these sacred spaces as he pursued his quest for God. In his book, Roohani Safar , His Holiness recounts that as he reached the age of puberty, his yearning to become a saint reached its pinnacle. However, he found no clear path to fulfill this deep desire. Driven by an unwavering devotion, he would spend days and nights near the shrine of Baba Gohar Ali Shah , immersed in the recitation of religious verses, hoping to uncover the spiritual truths he sought so fervently. His dedication during these formative years laid the foundation for his profound spiritual journey.

## Spritual Journey of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
At the age of 20, His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi embarked on his spiritual journey to find God. His first destination was Lal Bagh, a renowned Sufi site in Pakistan, where he began his search. However, his efforts were short-lived due to illusions and distractions caused by Satan. This initial failure weakened his belief in divinity and sainthood, leaving him disillusioned with religious scholars and Sufis. Disheartened, His Holiness shifted his focus to worldly life. He married, settled down, and had three children. For about 12 years, he lived a conventional life until he began experiencing profound spiritual dreams. In these dreams, a mysterious figure appeared, urging him to renounce worldly attachments and dedicate himself to religious practices. After about a year of these dreams, the figure gave a final command: to leave worldly life within three days to purify his lower self. In 1975, following this divine instruction, His Holiness journeyed to Sehwan Sharif, the shrine of Sufi Saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. His Holiness recounted his first night at Sehwan Sharif. While engaging in zikr (chanting the name of God), he fell asleep and saw a gathering of saints in his dream. Among them was a tall, robust man with a striking appearance, including a large build and long mustaches. The saint pointed towards him and recited a Punjabi verse: "Asaan haan Qalandar dewaany lajpaal dy" ("We are the ecstatic followers of Qalandar, the protector of the helpless.") From that night onward, His Holiness's heartbeat began to rhythmically chant the name of God. Overwhelmed with joy, he realized that the God he had been searching for in jungles, caves, and distant places had been within his own heart all along.
## Incident in Jungle With Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
His Holiness shared a remarkable incident from the Laal Bagh jungle. He recounted that one day, a tall, elderly man appeared and silently stared at him before walking towards a nearby canal. Around 3 AM, the same man returned. In the darkness, his eyes glowed like fire, casting an eerie presence. As he approached closer, His Holiness felt an intense shock course through his body. At that very moment, His Holiness's heartbeat began chanting the name of God at a rapid pace. Suddenly, a radiant white ball of light emerged from his chest and shot towards the old man. The glowing orb struck the man, causing him to step back in pain. Angered, the man began hurling stones at His Holiness. In this extraordinary moment, His Holiness saw a figure, identical to himself, emerge from his own body. This spiritual form stood before the tall man while His Holiness's physical body became invisible to him. It seemed to be his spiritual body—a divine manifestation. The spiritual body began reciting something and blew its breath towards the tall man, inflicting pain on him. In retaliation, the tall man recited his own verses and blew them back, causing discomfort to the spiritual body. This spiritual confrontation lasted for about 30 minutes. Eventually, flames started emerging from the tall man's mouth. In response, the spiritual body flew like a bird and perched atop a nearby palm tree. Enraged, the tall man threw stones, but his fiery breath and projectiles failed to reach the spiritual body. The tall man, consumed with anger, began climbing the palm tree to reach the spiritual body. However, just as he approached, the spiritual body soared into the sky like an eagle, leaving the tall man staring in disbelief and defeat. Realizing his inability to confront this divine entity, the tall man left the jungle, bewildered and anxious. AFollowing this incident, His Holiness's spiritual body began appearing to various people in different places. People reported seeing him in Sehwan, and when they came to the Laal Bagh jungle, they would also find him there simultaneously. This marked the emergence of nine other human-like figures resembling His Holiness. These spiritual forms joined him during zikr (chanting the name of God), during prayers, and even stood as protectors when he slept. They were not just passive beings; they actively helped those in need, assisting followers in their dreams or even physically appearing to guide and support them. This miraculous event further demonstrated the divine nature and spiritual power of His Holiness, strengthening the faith of those around him.

## Leaving Jungle
After spending approximately three years in the jungle, His Holiness received a divine command from God to leave the jungle and return to Hyderabad. The instruction was clear: serve humanity by sharing the knowledge of God and helping people reconnect with the Divine. Upon returning to Hyderabad, His Holiness chose a serene spot near Jamshoro, behind the Textbook Board. There, he built a simple hut that became a sanctuary for those seeking solace and spiritual guidance. His Holiness dedicated himself to healing the emotionally distressed and purifying people's hearts through the practice of zikr (chanting the name of God). People who had previously encountered His Holiness during his time in Sehwan began visiting this new location to continue seeking his blessings and wisdom. Word of his presence spread quickly, and his humble hut started attracting students from universities and medical colleges. These young minds showed a profound interest in the spiritual teachings and practices of zikr that His Holiness imparted. However, this growing attention did not sit well with everyone. The principal of one of the universities, noticing the students' increasing visits, tried to stop them but failed to deter their determination. Frustrated, the principal eventually instructed his staff to dismantle the hut. Following these orders, the hut was torn down. Despite this setback, His Holiness remained unwavering in his mission. He relocated to a new place within Hyderabad and continued his sacred work. Undeterred by obstacles, he persisted in awakening people's hearts, guiding them towards a deeper connection with God, and spreading the message of love and divinity. His efforts inspired countless individuals, leaving an indelible mark on their spiritual journeys.
## Anjuman Sarfuroshan-e-Islam - First Organization of Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi, in his book Roohani Safar, shares an insightful account of how the journey of spreading the Divine message began and need for an organization was felt. His Hollines writes:
- "In the beginning, when people started visiting me and showing interest, I thought, why not engage their services to spread this Divine message? At first, I approached elderly people to talk about heart zikr (chanting the name of God from the heart). They listened attentively and enjoyed the discourse, but none were willing to practice it. Then, I decided to reach out to the Islamic scholars. While a few nodded in agreement, the majority opposed this spiritual knowledge and the concept of heart awakening. Disheartened by their rejection, I turned my focus to the younger generation. Young hearts are relatively untainted compared to the older ones, and they not only accepted the message but also engaged with it practically. As a result, this Divine message of love and heart awakening began to spread rapidly—through mosques, streets, and bazaars. The number of lovers and practitioners of this message increased abruptly."
To manage the growing number of followers and the widespread interest in this spiritual mission, His Holiness founded the Anjuman Sarfroshan-e-Islam Organization. Under his supervision, this organization played a pivotal role in awakening and purifying the hearts of ordinary people, elevating their spiritual awareness, and spreading the Divine message of love and enlightenment. The organization's efforts transformed countless lives, fostering a profound connection with God and helping individuals find peace and purpose through spiritual practices. Through this structured approach, the mission of heart awakening continued to grow and inspire people from all walks of life.

## Disappearnce of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi
His Holiness Riaz Ahmed revealed in His presence that He would disappear for some time and later reappear in this world alongside Jesus Christ. This return is destined to counter the satanic powers and reconnect humanity with God through the teachings of love and heart awakening.
In anticipation of His disappearance, His Holiness appointed Younus AlGohar as His Divine Eminence's Representative. He declared, "Whoever wishes to meet Gohar Shahi (Himself) should meet Younus AlGohar." This appointment was a clear directive to ensure the continuation of His divine mission.
Despite the explicit instructions and foreknowledge provided by His Holiness about His disappearance, certain individuals, including His sons and some family members, falsely declared Him dead. They constructed a tomb in His name and began collecting money from followers, exploiting His Holiness's legacy for personal gain.
Furthermore, they rejected the divine order of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi to follow Younus AlGohar as His Representative. Instead, they unlawfully proclaimed themselves the inheritors of His mission and continue to mislead some followers with deceptive practices.
Today, His Holiness's sacred mission is under the guidance and supervision of Younus AlGohar through the establishment of a new organization, Messiah Foundation International. This organization is dedicated to preserving and spreading the true teachings and mission of His Holiness Riaz Ahmed.

## Remarks of the family members and friends of His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi:
> We never saw His Divine Eminence arguing, fighting or beating up anybody. If any of His friends was angry and wanted to get physical, His Divine Eminence would simply smile.’
## Remarks by wife of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:
> ‘Firstly, His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi is hardly ever angry, however, His Divine Eminence expresses intense reactions against immorality and indecency. His Divine Eminence is exceptionally generous. In the morning when His Divine Eminence leaves for the meeting with daily visitors in the lawn of the house, His pockets are full of money. However, when His Divine Eminence returns, the pockets are empty. His Divine Eminence gives away all the money to the needy. When I am in need of money, His Divine Eminence shows an innocent face, thus I get angry. Looking at His innocent face, I say a couplet, “Thou art so generous by heart, but parted with all the wealth. ”’
## Remarks by the Mother of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi: 
> ‘During His childhood, when He would not go to school for a day or two, or if He suffered a business loss later in life, I would criticise Him, but He would never raise His head in response. My Spiritual Guide, Kakka Miyan from the village of Shams, would advise me, “Do not swear at Riaz. You do not know what I see in Him.” He has so much sympathy for humanity that when He would find out that a passenger bus had broken down even at a distance of 10 miles, He would get food prepared for the passengers and would take it to them riding His bicycle.’
## Remarks by Mohammad Iqbal of Fazooliyan, a close friend of His Divine Eminence Gohar Shahi:
> Mohammad Iqbal says, ‘In the rainy season, as we would walk through the fields, we would walk on the trail, and countless ants also would be crawling there. We did not care about them, but His Divine Eminence Ra Gohar Shahi would always avoid walking on the trail, lest the ants are harmed or run over. His Divine Eminence would prefer to wade in the mud instead. When a false case of murder was instigated against His Divine Eminence, Qaddous Shiekh of the crime branch (of the police department) came for inquiry. The residents of the area told him, “We don’t think His Divine Eminence would have ever killed a mosquito, let alone a human being!”’
